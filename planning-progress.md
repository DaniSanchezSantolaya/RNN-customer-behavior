# 31 May - 14 June

Write the thesis draft

Attention could be reduced to the model without attention (Looking only at the last hidden state). Analyze this

# 09 May - 31 May

State big hyphotesis for every research question (why to do that) and for every subquestion.

Complete results table

Review Output Embeddings

Evaluate performance on different splits of the movies (Eg Top 10% with less ocurrences, second top 10%, and rest 80%)

Start writing

Statistical signicance test

Attention analysis

Embedding analysis - Eg. Look how they change when train jointly

# 26 April - 09 May

State:
- Research questions
- State of the art for each research questions, and results for the datasets, if available
- State all that can be done for this resarch questions

# 05 Arpil - 12 April

Get another data set (synthetic or real). Eg Movielens. 

Try to add more complexity on the model

# 29 March - 05 April

Evaluate the model without data augmentation
  - Training and test evaluation, and check if it is overfitting or underfitting
  - compare with the case of data augmentation 
  
Research which features the model is learning (tsne)

Try Attentional mechanism

# 22 March - 29 March

Experiment with the approach of different timescales

Experiment with PEGA data if available

Review if Phased LSTM can be used

Think new ways for evaluation

https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QdqOHdHIHp7mnlt6hfxfKTSE2N85xi-0CmZRZfPKhnA/edit?usp=sharing

# 15 March - 22 March

Think what to do different so the work incorporates some novelty


Prepare new test set in Santander data and evaluate with MAP and Top-k recall with this set

# 8 March - 15 March

Expand thesis proporsal with: data, evaluation, and baselines

Decide if use the coupons data set.

Complete experiment with doctor baseline and evaluation decided

# 22 February - 1 March

Research the related literature.

State some research questions and discuss them.

Pick the most relevant papers, and prepare a small presentation for them.

Implement RNN using the deltas instead the products in every moment, still with fixed sequence length

https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_hAfbtxnnAXjPR5s1gCQ8uj3oa_lGU96PeqcsGi8Dq8/edit?usp=sharing

# 16 February - 22 February

Implement basic GRU

Start to research the related literature (eg start with citations to the clinical predictions paper)
