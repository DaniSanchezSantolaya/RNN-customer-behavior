# RNN to predict customer behavior from interaction data

Customer behavior can be represented as sequential data describing the interactions
of the customer with a company or a system through the time. Examples of these interactions
are items that the customer purchases or views. Recurrent Neural Networks
are able to model effectively sequential data and learn directly from low-level features
without the need of feature engineering. In this work, we apply RNN to model this
interaction data and predict which items the user will consume in the future. Besides
exploring how effective are RNNs in this scenario, we study how item embeddings
can help when there is a high quantity of different items, providing a comparison and
analysis of different methods to learn embeddings. Finally, we apply attention mechanisms
to gain interpretability in the RNN model. We compare different variants of
attention mechanism, providing their performance and the usefulness to explain the
predictions of the model.
